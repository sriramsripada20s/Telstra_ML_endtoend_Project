# Telstra_ML_endtoend_Project

**ABSTRACT**

In the modern era of technology, importantly in the Telecommunication space, the challenge to drive customer advocacy and build a loyal customer base has always been a major challenge for all the telecom providers. Over the years both the network volume and network conditions have changed, service disruptions or service faults have been the important cause for reduction in the number of active users. Identifying fault severity at a certain location and time, has always been a crucial business statistic because the major purpose of organizations is to create consumer advocacy, which helps them save money and retain and better service their customers. In this report we try to predict fault severity at a location using data mining techniques and help organizations detect Service faults. Various machine learning models have been used to predict faults and evaluated based on various classification metrics.

**Problem definition**

In the recent years, emerging trends like 5G technology, IOT, AI, Big Data, Cyber Security and Cloud Computing are making up a large proportion of Industry 4.0 space, it is the need of the hour for all the industries to understand and start adopting these technologies so as to deliver best services to their customers. In order to provide best services, businesses should start understanding the needs of users and redirect their focus in building customer advocacy.

In the modern era of technology, importantly in the Telecommunication space, the challenge to drive customer advocacy and build a loyal customer base has always been a major challenge for all the telecom providers. Over the years both the network volume and network conditions have changed, service disruptions or service faults have been the important cause for reduction in the number of active users. The problem of service disruptions in the Telecom industry have been there for a long time and they occur due to various reasons ike overloaded networks, extreme weather conditions, malfunctioning equipment, upgradation of networks, introduction of new devices, misconfigurations due to human error in the network and outdated software frameworks for testing networks.

**Objective**

To predict Fault Severity at particular time and location based on log data available Fault severity has 3 categories: 0,1,2 (0 meaning no fault, 1 meaning only a few, and 2 meaning many)

Deployed Streamlit web app on Heroku Cloud created so that users could explore my LGBM Classification model predicting the Telstra network's Fault Severity at a time at a particular location based on the log data available.
